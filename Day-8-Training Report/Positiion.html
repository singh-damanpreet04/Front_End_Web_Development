		international levels. This game originated in England. Cricket was introduced 
		to the Indians by the British in the early 1700s. This game rules in everyone’s 
		heart in India and so it can be called the “king of the games”. Millions of 
		fans watch this game, and there is an air of excitement everywhere. It is 
		enjoyed by the old and young. Over the years, this game has gathered a huge 
		fan-base, who connects emotionally with it in our country.
	<strong>History of Cricket</strong>
		The game of cricket goes long back to British times. When it was introduced in 
		India, very few people played this game. The Maharaja of Patiala, Bhupinder Singh 
		brought this game into limelight. He was a great patron of sports. He played 
		cricket and he had his own team. Cricket was his second love after his kingdom. 
		He was the man behind the golden history of cricket due to his passion for the 
		game. His team Patiala XI was the best team during that time and he was the 
		captain of the Indian team. He himself sponsored his teams for the tours to 
		England.
		<strong>How is Cricket Played?</strong>
		Cricket is a game played by two teams of eleven players each on a pitch with two sets 
		of three stumps, which are called wickets. The bowler bowls the ball down the pitch to 
		the batsman of the opposing team, who must defend the wickets in front of which 
		he stands. The target of the game is to score as many runs as possible. 

		Runs are scored by individual players by running on the playing strip (called pitch) 
		between the wickets, or by hitting a ball that flies outside the boundary of the
		playground or which falls inside the boundary but bounces or rolls outside. 
		When the balls go directly outside the boundary, the batsman scores six runs, 
		and when the ball falls within the boundary but rolls outside then the batsman 
		scores four runs. The opponent team will bowl and field and their objective 
		is to take the wickets for each of the batsmen playing on the pitch. 

		A batsman can be dismissed in one of several ways: by the bowler hitting the wicket 
		with the ball, which is called, bowled; by a fielder catching the ball hit by 
		the batsman before it touches the ground and it is called caught; by the 
		wicket-keeper or another fielder breaking the stumps while the batsman attempts 
		a run and is therefore out of his ground. This is called stumped or run out. 
		A batsman can also be dismissed if the batsman breaks the wicket with his own 
		bat or body and this is called a hit wicket; by a part of the batsman’s body 
		being hit by a ball that would otherwise have hit the wicket is called leg before 
		the wicket or “lbw”. 

		A match consists of one or two innings, and each inning ends when the tenth 
		batsman of the batting team is out, when a certain number of overs 
		(an over: a series of six balls bowled) have been played or when the captain 
		of the batting team declares ending the innings voluntarily. 

		Forms of Cricket
		There are three forms of cricket: Test matches, one-day internationals, and T20 
		internationals. 

		Test matches are played for five days. To play this game, the players have to 
		excel mentally and physically. This game is played in white tees and trousers. 
		In this game, the players have to play for ninety overs each day. 

		In one-day internationals, the players play an inning of fifty overs. This kind 
		of cricket is played only for a day. It was introduced in the 1980s.

		T20 is the latest format of this game. In a T20 match, they play an inning of 
		only twenty overs. This game is pretty interesting and engaging. 

		Achievements by the Indian Team	
		India won its first world cup in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev. It was a 
		big win in the history of cricket. Next, they won the world cup in 2011 under 
		the captaincy of MS Dhoni. India also won the T20 ICC World trophy and ICC 
		Champions trophy in 2013 under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. Besides these 
		prestigious trophies, India has acclaimed many other victories in world cricket.
		Recently, India won it's 2<sup>nd</sup> T20 world cup in 2024, taking number of
		ICC Trophies to 4.
